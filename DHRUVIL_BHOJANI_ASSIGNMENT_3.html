<h3>IEEE History</h3>

    The IEEE formed in 1963 with the merger of the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers, formed in 1884), and the IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers, formed in 1912). From its earliest origins, the IEEE has: Advanced the theory and application of electro technology and allied sciences. Served as a catalyst for technological innovation. Â· Supported the needs of its members through a wide variety of programs and services. Through its members, the IEEE is a leading authority in technical areas ranging from computer engineering, biomedical technology and telecommunications, to electric power, aerospace and consumer electronics, among others. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is devoted to advancing the theory and application of electrical engineering, electronics, and computing.

<h3>IEEE Gujarat Section</h3>
<p>
    The IEEE Gujarat Section is one of the 11 IEEE Sections in India which comes under the Asia-Pacific region, R10 of IEEE. It was formed on 15 August 1990. It is one of the most important section in the R10 Region. It is headquartered at Ahmedabad, a place known mainly for its business oriented people.</p>
<p>
    IEEE activities started in Gujarat in 1988 from Baroda (now known as Vadodara), by the first IEEE Student Branch established at the Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology & Engineering, M S University. The Vadodara sub-section was formed in the year 1988, which was later changed to the entity to Gujarat Sub-section. On 15th August 1990 the Vadodara Sub-section was then upgraded to a full fledged Section and take its place amongst the 300 sections worldwide spread out over 150 countries.</p>
<p>
    The IEEE Gujarat University Student Branch was the next student branch unit established in 1994. The IEEE Gujarat Section was carved out from the IEEE Bombay Section mainly for logistic reasons.</p>
<p>
    Gujarat Section was first brought to international attention in 1997 with the holding of a twin conference onâ Internet Securityâ and EEE in the petroleum sector both downstream and upstream. This twin conference was held in the premises of the Institute of Reservoir Studies of the ONGC.</p>
